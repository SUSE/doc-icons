Documentation icons
===================

The SUSE Documentation Team use their own set of SVG icons designed to be compliant with the 
current SUSE brand guidelines.

Use these icons to build any diagram that is part of any piece of SUSE documentation.

Create your diagrams in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and use 
[svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) or [inkscape-svgo](https://github.com/konsumer/inkscape-svgo) to optimize the resulting SVG files.

Please test your diagrams extensively by running test builds of your document to determine whether 
you should include native SVG or PNG.
